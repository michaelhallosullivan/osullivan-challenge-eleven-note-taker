## Description

Students are tasked with creating a note taker that can store notes to a local back-end database called db.json.

## Installation

Run npm i to install all appropriate node packages (namely, express).

## Usage

Users can use the note-taker application to save notes. The notes are stored so they can be looked at later or even deleted upon completion!
